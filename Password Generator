TASK/PROJECT:
PASSWORD GENERATOR
A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and random passwords for users. This project aims to create a password generator application using Python,
allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the password.
User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password.
Generate Password: Use a combination of random characters to generate a password of the specified length.
Display the Password: Print the generated password on the screen.

PROGRAM(CODE):
import random
# The string package is imported with an alias name s
import string as s 

#generatePswd is the password generator function
def generatePswd(l):
    if l < 1:
        return "Error! Password length must be at least 1."
    
    # Define character sets to use in the password
    # c define the characters in the password that is being generated
    c = s.ascii_letters + s.punctuation + s.digits
    
    # Generate a random password
    pswd = ''.join(random.choice(c) for i in range(l))
    
    return pswd

def main():
    while True:
        try:
            #l : length
            l = int(input("\nEnter the desired length of the password: ").strip())
        except ValueError:
            print("\nInvalid input. Please enter a numeric value.\n")
            continue
        
        pswd = generatePswd(l)
        print(f"\nThe Computer Generated Password: {pswd}\n")
        
        nxt = input("Do you want to generate another password? (Y/N): ").strip().lower()
        if nxt != 'y':
            print("Thank you...")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


OUTPUT:
Enter the desired length of the password: 5

The Computer Generated Password: QT93*

Do you want to generate another password? (Y/N): y

Enter the desired length of the password: 7

The Computer Generated Password: 4yu[d;E

Do you want to generate another password? (Y/N): n
Thank you...
