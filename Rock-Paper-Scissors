TASK/PROJECT:
Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
User Input: Prompt the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors.
Computer Selection: Generate a random choice (rock, paper, or scissors) for the computer.
Game Logic: Determine the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's choice.
Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
Display Result: Show the user's choice and the computer's choice.
Display the result, whether the user wins, loses, or it's a tie.
Score Tracking (Optional): Keep track of the user's and computer's scores for multiple rounds.
Play Again: Ask the user if they want to play another round.
User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and feedback.
