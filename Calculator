TASK/PROJECT:
Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice.
Perform the calculation and display the result.



PROGRAM(CODE):
#Alias names of n1 and n2 are x and y respectively.
def addition(x, y):
    return x + y
def subtraction(x, y):
    return x - y
def multiplication(x, y):
    return x * y
def division(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        return "Error! Division by zero."
    return x / y

OUTPUT:
Simple Calculator
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 3
Choose an operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
Enter the number corresponding to the operation: 2
Result: 5.0 - 3.0 = 2.0

Do you want to continue performing calculation? (Y/N): y

Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 2
Choose an operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
Enter the number corresponding to the operation: 1
Result: 5.0 + 2.0 = 7.0

Do you want to continue performing calculation? (Y/N): Y

Enter the first number: 6
Enter the second number: 2
Choose an operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
Enter the number corresponding to the operation: 4
Result: 6.0 / 2.0 = 3.0

Do you want to continue performing calculation? (Y/N): y

Enter the first number: 87
Enter the second number: 23.56
Choose an operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
Enter the number corresponding to the operation: 2
